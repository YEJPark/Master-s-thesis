# Master's Thesis Code Repository

This repository contains the code used in my Master's thesis:

**_Exploring Characteristics and Interactions of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF): An Integrated Analysis Using Single-Cell RNA-seq Data_**  
(Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea)

## Overview of Contents

### 1. scRNA-seq Preprocessing

- **Scripts:**
  - `scRNA_preprocessing.py`
  - `scRNA_preprocessing.ipynb`
  
  These scripts are used for preprocessing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.

### 2. Further Analysis

- **Cell Type Frequency Analysis:**
  - `Celltype_frequency_analysis.py`: Analyzes cell type frequencies within the dataset.
  
- **Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG) Analysis:**
  - `DEG_analysis.py`: Performs differential gene expression analysis to identify key genes.
  
- **Pathway Enrichment Analysis:**
  - `Pathway_enrichment_analysis.py`: Conducts pathway enrichment analysis to explore biological processes.

### 3. Validation

- **Validation for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF):**
  - `Validation_IPF.py`: Scripts for validating the findings related to IPF.
  
- **Validation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):**
  - `Validation_COPD.py`: Scripts for validating the findings related to COPD.
